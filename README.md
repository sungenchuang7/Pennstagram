**How to run the app?**

1. **Backend**

    Navigate to backend folder and run "npm start". The backend is default to port 8080. 

2. **Frontend**

    Navigate to frontend and run "npm start". The frontend is default to port 3000. 


**Things to Note**

1. We use email as user identifier and each email should be unique. Use email to search for a user.

2. We try not to suppress ESlint warnings and errors, but sometimes it's hard. I got TA's approval to suppress some. 

3. Before running, make sure .env and bucket name is correct.
